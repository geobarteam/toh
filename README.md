This is project contains a .NetCore WebApi project implementing the famous Google "Tour of Heroes".
I use this project to provide demos for my security course on making secure application with Angular and ASP.NET Core.
Each demo is located on a separate branch.


To start the project you need to setup a SqlExpress DB named: TourOfHeroes.
then you can execute  '\toh-db\createtable.sql'.
